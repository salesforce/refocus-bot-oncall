# Oncall-Bot
This is the repository for a bot that enables Site Reliability to reach out to Service Matter Experts (SMEs) during incidents. Our users need a way to contact people from Rooms who are on-call during incidents. It was designed and developed to be used inside & in conjunction with [Refocus Rooms](https://github.com/salesforce/refocus).

## Features
* Ability to search escalation policies (https://support.pagerduty.com/v1/docs/escalation-policies).
* Ability to select one or multiple escalation policies.
* 1-button paging feature of selected escalation policies.
* Notification message text is configurable.
